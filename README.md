# Pagefleet

[Install in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1243840737950472379)

### The Purpose
Pagefleet is built to help you save time by instantly generating all necessary pages for your design project instead of having to create them one by one. It comes equipped with three diverse templates that have been tailored to suit small, medium, and large design projects. Whether you're working on a website design, mobile app or a robust e-commerce site, Pagefleet has got you covered. To add to its versatility, it includes a custom feature that allows you reuse and edit any of the prebuilt templates to match your requirements.



### How to use Pagefleet

#### Quickstart

Begin by running the plugin. Under the 'Quickstart' tab, you can select the project type that resonates with your requirements. Upon selection, a pre-defined set of pages are generated instantly, setting the stage for you to dive into your project.

#### Custom

If you wish to customize one of the templates, navigate to the 'Custom' tab and select the template you'd like to reuse. Once your template is selected, you have the freedom to modify the names of the pages by simply clicking on them. After you've made your desired changes, click on 'Generate Pages' to produce your own custom set of pages.

#### Limitations

- If you are editing pre-defined template, you'll need to delete that value from the textarea before generating the pages.
- If you are running the plugin on a fresh Figma file, it will rename the current page you're at with the first name in the template.
- If you already have a few pages setup, running the plugin will rename only the current page and append the rest of the pages below it.
